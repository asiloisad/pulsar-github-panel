# github-panel

- **Code reviews** -- View review comments and threads directly in the editor
- **Comment decorations** -- Show review comments as inline decorations on the current branch
- **Issue/PR opener** -- Open any issue or pull request by URL
- **Repository management** -- Create and publish repositories to GitHub
- **Status bar** -- GitHub icon for quick panel access
